This web tool lets you view, filter and export the data points you have collected with the CellMapper, G-MoN Pro and Tower Collector applications on your Android device.

### Filters
You can filter hundreds or thousands of data points to be able to focus only on what you actually care about. Available filters include PLMN, network type (LTE and NR), Band, Frequency, (e/g)NodeB (site ID) and cell ID. You can apply filters at once or only a few depending on what you want. Additionally, you can search the filter options to quickly find what you are looking for.

### Visualization
You can visualize the data points that you have collected with the CellMapper and G-MoN Pro applications on a map. You can see each collected data point in detail with information rich tooltips and popups.

### Export
You like what you see on the map. Then you can go ahead and export the map as an HTML file to preserve the currently displayed data points to look at them again later or for sharing with others.

### Local in browser processing
All processing of the data happens on your device in the browser. The CSV files you select to view, filter and export are not uploaded to any server. The location permission is optional and only used to center the map based on your location. Your location is not shared with anyone!
